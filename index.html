        <div class="section"><h2>System Out and Err Redirected to SLF4J</h2>
<p>The sysout-over-slf4j module allows a user to redirect all calls to System.out and System.err to an SLF4J defined logger with the name of the fully qualified class in which the System.out.println (or similar) call was made, at configurable levels.</p>
<div class="section"><h3>What are the intended use cases?</h3>
<p>The sysout-over-slf4j module is for cases where your legacy codebase, or a third party module you use, prints directly to the console and you would like to get the benefits of a proper logging framework, with automatic capture of information like timestamp and the ability to filter which messages you are interested in seeing and control where they are sent.</p>
<p>The sysout-over-slf4j module is explicitly not intended to encourage the use of System.out or System.err for logging purposes. There is a significant performance overhead attached to its use, and as such it should be considered a stop-gap for your own code until you can alter it to use SLF4J directly, or a work-around for poorly behaving third party modules.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3>What needs to be done to make it work?</h3>
<p>sysout-over-slf4j.jar should be included on the classpath at the same level as slf4j-api.jar and your chosen slf4j implementation.</p>
<p>A static method call sendSystemOutAndErrToSLF4J() should be made on the org.slf4j.sysoutslf4j.context.SysOutOverSLF4J class early in the life of the application to start redirecting calls to SLF4J, or the included org.slf4j.sysoutslf4j.context.SysOutOverSLF4JServletContextListener may be configured in a servlet application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>The System.out and System.err PrintStreams are replaced with new SLF4JPrintStreams. Each time a call to System.out.println (or similar) is made, the current thread's stacktrace is examined to determine which class made the call. An SLF4J Logger named after that class's fully qualified name is retrieved and the message logged at the configured level on that logger (by default info for System.out calls and error for System.err calls).</p>
<p>Calls to Throwable.printStackTrace() are likewise logged at the configured level for each System output. By default there will be a message logged for every line of the stack trace; this is an unfortunate side effect of not being able to retrieve the original exception that is being printed reliably.</p>
<p>A servlet container may contain multiple web applications. If it has child first class loading and these applications package SLF4J in the web-app/lib directory then there will be multiple SLF4J instances running in the JVM. However, there is only one System.out and one System.err for the whole JVM. In order to ensure that the correct SLF4J instance is used for the correct web application, inside the new PrintStreams SLF4J instances are mapped against the context class loader to ensure that the same SLF4J instance used in &quot;normal&quot; logging is also used when calling System.out.println.</p>
<p>In order to prevent classloader leaks when contexts are reloaded the new PrintStreams are created by a special classloader so that they do not themselves maintain a reference to the context classloader. The PrintStreams only maintain a weak reference to the classloaders and their SLF4J instances, so that no classloader leak occurs if the classloader is discarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3>Don't most logging systems print to the console? Won't that mean infinite recursion?</h3>
<p>Fortunately, Log4J, JULI &amp; Logback all do so through the write methods on PrintStream, which are rarely used for direct logging. Consequently these methods on the new PrintStreams proxy directly to the old System.out/err PrintStreams, allowing these logging frameworks to work as before.</p>
<p>Other SLF4J implementations may not fit this useful pattern. They can be registered with sysout-over-slf4j via static methods on the SysOutOverSLF4J class to permit them to access the console.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3>What about the overhead?</h3>
<p>The overhead for Log4J, JULI and Logback when printing to the console should be minimal, for the reasons outlined above.</p>
<p>The overhead for any other SLF4J implementation that needed to be registered will be greater; on every attempt by it to print to the console its fully qualified classname has to be matched against registered package names in order to determine whether it should be permitted direct access.</p>
<p>Finally, the overhead of actual System.out and System.err calls will be much greater, due to the expense of generating the thread's stacktrace and examining it to determine the origin of the call. As emphasised above, it would be much better if all logging were done via SLF4J directly and this module were not necessary.</p>
